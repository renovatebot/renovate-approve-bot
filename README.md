# renovate-approve-bot

A GitHub App that serves only to submit approving Pull Request Reviews for PRs from [Renovate Bot](https://github.com/apps/renovate). This enables you to require Pull Request Reviews on your project while also still utilising Renovate's "automerge" benefits.

If you are using the Mend Renovate App for github.com then you can install a hosted version of this approve bot here: https://github.com/apps/renovate-approve
